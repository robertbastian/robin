         A round-robin tournament is set up, and each participant can add their own challenges. After the deadline for each challenge, the setter compares the solutions and gives each a rating, but moreover, <em>each participant rates the challenge that was set</em>.<br />
      <br />
        Thus Robin improves your programming not only by encouraging you to write good answers, but to write good questions as well.
